# sign_language_recognition
This is the sign language recognition project where I have used American Sign Language images to recognize A-Z alphabets. Here I have used html, css and javascript for frontend and Python's flask and SQLite for backend. I have used various libraries of python like, mediapipe, os2, numpy, etc. for the purpose.
